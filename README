  SPINSV

    A service runner inspired by runsv.

. background

  A common need encountered when running services on a unix system is
  to pipe the output of one service into the input of another, (often
  a log service such as `svlogd`). This looks something like this:

      #!/bin/sh

      service | log-service

  There are several problems with this approach, however:

    * There is no monitoring: if either of the services die,
      they aren't restarted.
    * It's hard to inspect the state of the process pair,
      especially if it goes down.
    * Even if the script is restarted when either of the services
      fails, this means the log service will cause a restart of the
      other service if it dies.
    * There is no single entry point to managing the process pair.

. rationale

  To have a completely stateless[1] service runner configurable via
  the command line.

  1. spinsv doesn't need file system access for configuration
     or operation.
